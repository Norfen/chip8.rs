Chip8.rs
========

A simple Chip8 emulator written in Rust with a focus on code clarity and ease of extensibility.

Probably has a few bugs and a ton of emulation gotchas.

###Build Instructions

Clone the repo, ```cargo build``` and twiddle your thumbs for a bit. Only tested on linux, but should(?) be cross platform thanks to SDL2.
